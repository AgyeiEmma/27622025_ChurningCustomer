Customer churn is a term used to describe when customers leave a business within a specific period of time.
It is a major concern for businesses, and to address this issue, a customer churn prediction program has been developed.
This program uses key client characteristics such as tenure, online security, OnlineBackup, contractuale, PaperlessBilling, and totalCharges to predict when a customer may leave(Churn).
For example, tenure describes the duration over which a client has stayed connected to the service provider, and long-term service may indicate more loyalty and a lower risk of leaving.
OnlineSecurity simulates signing up for identity theft services, and customers strengthened by online security may be less likely to leave. 
The program uses machine learning algorithms to create a churn model, and the dataset should include every available explanatory variable and a target(Churn). 
By predicting churn, businesses can identify at-risk customers, pain points leading up to churn, and take proactive actions to prevent churn and sustain growth efforts.
